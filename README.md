# Frame-prediction for video frames
Modified temporal prediction code that is used for image processing is modified to analyse multiple frames of a video at the same time. 
The code shows the error in frames using motion vector prediction.  
A loop function is used to analyse multiple frames.
The analysed frames are then saved into a folder.
